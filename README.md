# ticktickSMS

You know that one guy on your Slack team who never responds to messages? **ticktickSMS** is a Slack app that lets you bother him better.

ticktickSMS utilizes the Twilio API to send SMS messages (retrieved from your Slack team's user directory) on a specified timeout. These messages are cancellable using a button visible both to the sender and receiver.

ticktickSMS is written in Python 3.6 using the Flask microframework. It is still in development and will be submitted to the Slack app store upon completion.
